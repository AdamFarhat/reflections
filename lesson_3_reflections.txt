When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your workk local?

	Having a remote repository is useful when you working in a team where other memebers have to access your code.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Your local file may be more up-to-date than the ones on the remote repository so you wouldn't want to pull an older version.
